 * The function receives pointers to the elements passed in hashmap_insert() as an argument
 * It should return 0 if the keys are not equal, and non-zero if they are.
 *
 * @param hash_fun Function pointer to a hash function used to generate hash values from keys.
 * The function receives a pointer to the element passed in hashmap_insert() as an argument
 *
 * @param cleanup_fun Function pointer to a cleanup function called before an element is removed from the hashmap.
 * The function receives a pointer to the element passed in hashmap_insert() as an argument
 * If no cleanup is required, set this to `NULL`.
 *
 * @note The `cleanup_fun` is particularly useful when storing dynamically allocated data in the hashmap.
 * It ensures that memory is properly freed before the element is removed.
